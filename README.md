# Servo-Motor-with-Potentiometer

## The project was created using an Arduino to control 6 servo motors using 6 potentiometers for each.
Two circuit diagrams was provided:
1- Circuit.png
This is to show how the servos and the potentiometers are connected with the Arduino.
2- Circuit on Simulation.png
This to show the circuit when the simulation begins while each servo in a different position following the Potentiometers position.

The code was provided in the .ino file.
